# This is the configuration of my ratpoison
# window manager. I am in the process of
# switching to completely mouseless computer
# usage. It boosts efficiency and forces the
# user to continously learn new tools,
# expanding outside of your comfot zones.
#
# I am a regular Vim user, thus getting
# into highly keyboard-driven usage is
# coming very naturally to me. Recently
# I'm also testing Vimperator or Vrome 
# browser to possibly expand my toolset.
